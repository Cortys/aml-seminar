The training of classifiers on big datasets is an important problem in many domains.
This paper gives an overview of optimization methods that aim to speed up the training process.
We describe two approaches to speed up hyperparameter optimization by learning probabilistic models of error functions.
We then present methods to adapt bootstrapping, gradient descent, logistic regression and SVMs to big datasets.
